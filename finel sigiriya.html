        <h1>WHAT IS SIGIRIYA?</h1>
        <p>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in northern Sri Lanka. This megalithic rock was formed by a hard magma plate left behind by an extinct volcano. The local people consider it as the “eighth wonder of the world.”</p>
            <img src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x624/p0b7n6d7.jpg" height="250px" width="300px" class="one">
        <p>Sigiriya is visibly breath-taking and can be spotted from miles away, rising majestically between the surrounding landscape. It’s immersed in a thick jungle with both Stupa and numerous statues of Buddha, creating one of the most evocative and fascinating landscapes of Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the top of the rock offers fantastic 360-degree views of the beautiful surrounding area.</p>
        
       
      <p> Sigiriya is the most-visited historic site in Sri Lanka and is one of only 7 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. Read on for 10 interesting facts about Sigiriya!</p><br>

        <h1><b>10 Interesting Facts About Sigiriya, Sri Lanka</b></h1>
        <h3>1. The citadel on top of Sigiriya was built by King Kasyapa who ruled from 477 to 495 CE</h3>
        <p align="left">
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/690/0*hBnRDmyNNi22UDRh.jpg" height="150px" width="100px" class="two">
        The King chose Sigiriya as his residence because it provided adequate protection from attack. Kasyapa’s brother, Moggallana, was the rightful heir to the throne. Therefore,the King was aware of potential conflict arising. From the top of Sigiriya he had unobstructed views of the surrounding area. Clearly, this allowed any invasion or impending danger from afar to be easily seen coming in advance. </p><br>

Additionally, the King constructed lavish landscaped gardens throughout and a moat with ramparts surrounded the complex for protection. Today, the upper palace is the oldest surviving palace of Sri Lanka, and the gardens are the oldest surviving in the whole of Asia. </p>

 <h3>4.Sigiriya has an advanced hydraulic system</h3>
 <p>This impressive system consists of canals, lakes, dams, bridges, and water pumps which still provide water to the site’s gardens to this day! Evidently, this contributes largely to Sigiriya’s reputation as one of the world’s best-preserved examples of urban planning.</p>

 <h3>5.A  video of wonder of the sri lanka <b>SIGIRIYA</b></h3>
 <p>Sigiriya Rock Fortress in Sri lanka (aka Lion Rock) is the #1 attraction in the country. In this episode I feature this  popular tourist known as the 8th wonder of the world. It's also one of eight UNESCO World Heritage sites in Sri Lanka. Sigiriya is truly a remarkable place, so I hope you enjoy this video.</p>
 <p>Located in a rural part of the country Sigiriya was built around the 3rd century B.C. and was used as a monastery for 800 years. By the fifth century Sigiriua became a royal palace.</p> 

<p>This national monument is essentially broken up into two parts, the massive royal gardens at the base, and the royal palace at the top of the monolithic rock. In order to reach the top, it requires a semi arduous hike up some 1200 plus steps, which will take you 45 minutes to an hour to climb (allocate at least 3 hours to climb and explore). It’s best to do it early in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat of the day.</p>

<h2>The best way to reach Sigiriya from Colombo is by train and will cost you between LKR 800-1,200. It is an hour and 33 minutes from Colombo. However, there are no direct trains to Sigiriya. The best option is to board the train from Colombo Fort to Habrana, which is 15 km away.</h2>
