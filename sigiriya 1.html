        <h1>WHAT IS SIGIRIYA?</h1>
        <p>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in northern Sri Lanka. This megalithic rock was formed by a hard magma plate left behind by an extinct volcano. The local people consider it as the “eighth wonder of the world.”</p>
            <img src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x624/p0b7n6d7.jpg" height="250px" width="300px" class="one">
        <p>Sigiriya is visibly breath-taking and can be spotted from miles away, rising majestically between the surrounding landscape. It’s immersed in a thick jungle with both Stupa and numerous statues of Buddha, creating one of the most evocative and fascinating landscapes of Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the top of the rock offers fantastic 360-degree views of the beautiful surrounding area.</p>
        
       
      <p> Sigiriya is the most-visited historic site in Sri Lanka and is one of only 7 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. Read on for 10 interesting facts about Sigiriya!</p><br>

        <h1><b>10 Interesting Facts About Sigiriya, Sri Lanka</b></h1>
        <h3>1. The citadel on top of Sigiriya was built by King Kasyapa who ruled from 477 to 495 CE</h3>
        <p align="left">

        The King chose Sigiriya as his residence because it provided adequate protection from attack. Kasyapa’s brother, Moggallana, was the rightful heir to the throne. Therefore,the King was aware of potential conflict arising. From the top of Sigiriya he had unobstructed views of the surrounding area. Clearly, this allowed any invasion or impending danger from afar to be easily seen coming in advance. </p><br>
